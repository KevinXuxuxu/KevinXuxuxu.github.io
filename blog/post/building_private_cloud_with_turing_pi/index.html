    <p>I was one of the backers when <a href="https://turingpi.com/product/turing-pi-2/">Turing Pi 2</a> was on kickstarter, and received the stuff around April 2023. But at that time there wasn't any available <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4/">rpi cm4</a> for me to buy, so the plan was postponed util just last Thanksgiving. I got 4 rpi cm4 4G lite version, and finally started to build a private cloud out of these.</p>
<p>The plan was simple, boot everything up, install some container orchestration (most likely <a href="https://k3s.io">k3s</a>) and start to move my web services (probably also my GF's) to local. Just going full &quot;self-hosted&quot;. But later I realized that there are much more details that I need to learn or deal with, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Casing and thermals. Turing Pi 2 is supposed to fit in any mini-ITX case, but I have some personal preference and also cooling is another thing to worry about.</li>
<li>Supporting hardwares and compatibility. I will need additional storage (preferably performant ones) to go with the cluster but hardware of specific form factor needs sourcing, and there's some specifications about the Turing Pi 2 board IO connectivity and rpi cm4 compatibility issues that needs some attention.</li>
<li>Software to learn and try. Although I have quite some experience working with k8s from work, setting up k3s in a more embedded environment with all the networking, security and resource constraint to deal with is going to be a challenge to me.</li>
<li>The most underrated challenge is going to be finding stuff to achieve with the setup that actually make sense and meaningful. I have a handful of services that I could try to run on the cluster, but that's probably not the best idea for all of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>My current progress is that I have a cluster with 4 rpi cm4 setup with k3s and ready to run some of my workload, but the casing and cooling is not resolved so not in a long-running state. I will update to this post (or link to new posts) about my previous setups and lessons learnt, and also new progress I would make in the future. Wish me luck!</p>
